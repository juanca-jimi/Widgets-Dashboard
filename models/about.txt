A schema lets you define the structure of an entry into the collection.
The entry is called a document in the db

NOTE:
A collection is synonymous to a table in a relational db
A document is synonymous to a row in a relational db

In Mongoose, you need to use models to create, read, update, or delete items from a MongoDB collection.
